          <h1>About the website</h1>

          <p>
            This website was built using the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>,
            which incorporates R Markddown into the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> framework. The design of the
            website is based on the template <em>hugo universal</em>, originally developed by
            <a href="https://bootstrapious.com/free-templates">Bootstrapious</a> and ported to Hugo by
            <a href="https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme">DevCow</a>. The animated globe is a modification of
            a script by Joan Perals (<a href="https://codepen.io/jperals/pen/ExYqwyJ">https://codepen.io/jperals/pen/bWjPPg</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the code was directly written in HTML, CSS and Javascript (e.g. the  CV and about page, ToC).
            All code (.Rmd) is available in the github repository <a href="https://github.com/saskiaotto/mds_blog">saskiaotto/mds_blog</a>.

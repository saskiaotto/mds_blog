<p><strong>Data Analysis With R</strong>: This is a course taught by me as part of the curriculum of the Master program MARSYS at the Institute of Marine Ecosystem and Fishery Science, University of Hamburg, Germany. The course can be used as a short-term (e.g. 1 week) intensive training or in a self-study mode at the Bachelor, Master or PhD level. <br> The course introduces the principles of data science and how to mine out insights from data to understand complex behaviors, trends, and inferences. It teaches skills in three major areas with a focus on marine topics. <a href="https://mareds.github.io/r_course/index.html">Access course ..</a> <br></p>

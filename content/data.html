<h1>Databases</h1>
<p>In the following you find a list of databases and repositories that provide different type of marine data for specific regions free of charge. The list is not intended to be exhaustive but more to give you an easy start and many of these database can be webscraped directly from within R using specific packages that I also list here. If you feel there is any global or regional database missing where users can download marine data, don’t hesitate to <a href="/contact/index.html">contact</a> me! <br> <br></p>

<h1>Other Repositories</h1>
<p><strong>KNB</strong> - Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity <a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org" class="uri">https://knb.ecoinformatics.org</a><br> KNB is an international repository intended to facilitate ecological and environmental research (terrestrial, freshwater, and marine). The foundation of the KNB is the rich, detailed metadata provided by researchers that collect data, which promotes both automated and manual integration of data into new projects. KNB is a DataOne member node.</p>
<p><strong>DataONE</strong> - Data Observation Network for Earth <a href="https://www.dataone.org">www.dataone.org</a><br> DataONE is a community driven project providing access to data across multiple member repositories, supporting enhanced search and discovery of earth and environmental data. The default software for search and discovery of data and metadata within DataONE is <a href="https://search.dataone.org/data">DataONE Search</a>.</p>

<h1>Data packages in R</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Oceanographic data</strong> can be found in <a href="https://github.com/dankelley/ocedata">ocedata</a>. This package supplies some large oceanographic datasets useful for the <code>oce</code> package, e.g. world coastlines at medium and fine-scale resolution, time series of NASA/GISS land-ocean temperature index, Gulf Stream position or Annually-averaged sea-surface temperature and salinity from the World Ocean Atlas (WOA).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fisheries-related data sets</strong> are available in the packages <a href="https://github.com/droglenc/FSA">FSA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/droglenc/FSAdata">FSAdata</a> and <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/fishmethods/versions/1.10-4">fishmethods</a>. A good overview of datasets in these package is given by Derek Ogle’s website <a href="http://derekogle.com/fishR/data/byPackage">fishR</a>.</p></li>

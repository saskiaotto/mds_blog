# Databases

In the following you find a list of databases and repositories that provide different type of marine data for specific regions free of charge. The list is not intended to be exhaustive but more to give you an easy start and many of these database can be webscraped directly from within R using specific packages that I also list here. If you feel there is any global or regional database missing where users can download marine data, don't hesitate to [contact](/contact/index.html) me!

# Any comments or questions?

Are you curious about something? Do you have any questions? Let me know and I will try to answer them. If you have any information on **interesting data bases** or **R packages** I should add to the list, let me know. And if you have any **tutorial** or **online course** related to MDS that you would like to share through this platform you are more then welcome! Just let me know and we can link it through github.

Please feel free to contact me by email [saskia.otto@uni-hamburg.de](mailto:saskia.otto@uni-hamburg.de) or by dropping me some lines through this form:

## Which programming languages should you learn for marine data science?

First of all, there is no easy answer and no consensus either. Choosing from the broad range of programming languages the right one to invest time and effort learning it the next month or years is not trivial. It all boils down to what you plan to do with it and whether you want an open source program or can afford a license.

If you are a marine scientist that manages rather small datasets or queries data from existing databases using specific web interfaces or user-friendly programs and then runs some statistics on this data for either a report or a peer-reviewed articles, a program specifically developed for data analysis might be the best option for you. On the other hand, if you are a data scientist in a marine research institute, you might also need to build relational databases for storage of institute-specific datasets or develop tools for specific method applications, communicate the work through different channels such as software or coding repositories as well as static and dynamic websites. In that case knowing several additional programming languages such as SQL, HTML, CSS would be necessary. If you work with big datasets such as sequence and high-throughput screening data or digital image data from optical sensor systems you will need a programming languages which performs particularly fast. The key here is to understand your usage requirements in terms of generality vs. specificity, as well as your personal preferred development style of performance vs. productivity.

Some noteworthy aspects when choosing a language are:

- **Purpose of application**: Not every lanugage offers similar functionality for data storage, visualization, and analysis. Also, much of the day-to-day work in data science revolves around collecting and processing raw data for quick visualization and simple analysis. For this, fancy machine learning packages are not necessarily helpful. 
- **Compiled, interpreted, or JIT-compiled** language
    - Compiled = good performance: A so-called *compiler* translates the language into the machine's native language; this lets the code run fast, particularly if the compiler is effective at optimizing. But the compiling process may take time and the resulting code might not port well across operating systems. 
    - Interpreted = good protability: A so-called *interpreter* reads and executes the language. The advantage here is generally a better portability across systems and little compiling time. On the other side, intepretated languages are usually slower than equivalent compiled languages.
    - JIT-compiled = balance between performance and portability: *Just-In-Time* compiled languages are quickly compiled when programs written in them need to be run, usually with little optimization.
- **High or low level** language
    - High: Focuses more on concepts that are easy to understand by the human mind (objects, mathematical functions); it is, hence, easier to develop programs based on high-level languages
    - Low: More similar to the computer's native language, i.e. machine code, and particularly suitable for high performance programs that need access to the hardware. Low level langauges are difficult to port to other platforms and practically never interpreted. However, many languages offer low-level elements.
- What **type system**: type systems refer to the rules that the different types of variables of a language have to follow. Different types refer to the
    - checking (static vs. dynamic): If a language is statically typed, then the compiler or interpreter does the type checking once before the program runs or is compiled. If the language is dynamically type checked, then the types are checked at run-time. Generally, statically typed languages are considerably more fail-proof than dynamically typed. 
    - strength (strong vs weak) 
    - expression (manifest vs. inferred)
    - safety
- **Standardization**: Some languages follow a formal standard (e.g. ISO or ANSI), which can be relevant if different programs need to work together.

So let's see what other data scientiests and statisticians think, but bare in mind that some of these languages and tools do not serve the same purpose and are better used complementary.


#### Common technologies and languages in data science
Amongst the ~16,000 data scientists that participated in the 2017 [kaggle survey](https://www.kaggle.com/amberthomas/kaggle-2017-survey-results){#kaggle_anchor} (see also under <a href="../mds/index.html">MDS</a>) the following data science/analytics tools, technologies, and languages were used most often:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rlang)
library(wordcloud)
library(colormap)

cleanMCData <- read.csv('stats_data/multipleChoiceResponses.csv', stringsAsFactors = TRUE, header = TRUE)

question <- "WorkToolsSelect"
programs_used <- cleanMCData %>% 
  filter(!UQ(sym(question)) == "") %>%
  select_(question) %>% 
  mutate(totalCount = n()) %>% 
  mutate(selections = strsplit(as.character(UQ(sym(question))), 
    '\\([^)]+,(*SKIP)(*FAIL)|,\\s*', perl = TRUE)) %>%
  unnest(selections) %>% 
  group_by(selections) %>% 
  count(selections, sort = TRUE)

fig_cap_program <- "Wordcloud of most common languages and tools amongst all data scientist."
```

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.asp=0.5, fig.align="center", tidy = TRUE, fig.cap=fig_cap_program} 
programs_used %>%
  with(wordcloud(selections, n, 
          scale = c(3,0.2), 
          max.words = 150, 
          random.order = FALSE, 
          rot.per = 0.35, 
          use.r.layout = TRUE, 
          colors = brewer.pal(6, "Blues")[c(4,5,6,7,8,9)])
  )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
programs_acad <- cleanMCData %>% 
  filter(str_detect(EmployerIndustry, c("Academic"))) %>%
  filter(!UQ(sym(question)) == "") %>%
  select_(question) %>% 
  mutate(total_count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(selections = strsplit(as.character(UQ(sym(question))), 
    '\\([^)]+,(*SKIP)(*FAIL)|,\\s*', perl = TRUE)) %>%
  unnest(selections) %>% 
  group_by(selections) %>% 
  summarise(total_count = max(total_count),
    count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percent = (count / total_count) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(percent) %>%
  filter(percent > 15) %>%
  mutate(selections = fct_inorder(factor(selections))) 
  
programs_stat <- cleanMCData %>% 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(CurrentJobTitleSelect, "Statistician") ) %>%
  filter(!UQ(sym(question)) == "") %>%
  select_(question) %>% 
  mutate(total_count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(selections = strsplit(as.character(UQ(sym(question))), 
    '\\([^)]+,(*SKIP)(*FAIL)|,\\s*', perl = TRUE)) %>%
  unnest(selections) %>% 
  group_by(selections) %>% 
  summarise(total_count = max(total_count),
    count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percent = (count / total_count) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(percent) %>%
  filter(percent > 15) %>%
  mutate(selections = fct_inorder(factor(selections))) 

fig_cap_acad_stat <- "Barplot of most common languages and tools amongst academic data scientist (left) and statisticians (right)."
```

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.asp=0.5, fig.align="center", tidy = TRUE, fig.cap=fig_cap_acad_stat} 
p_acad <- programs_acad %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = selections, y = percent, fill = selections)) +
    geom_col() + guides(fill = "none") +
    colormap::scale_fill_colormap(discrete = T, colormap = colormaps$salinity,
     reverse = T ) +
    theme_classic() + 
    ylim(0,100) + coord_flip() +
    ylab("Percent") + xlab("")

p_stat <- programs_stat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = selections, y = percent, fill = selections)) +
    geom_col() + guides(fill = "none") +
    colormap::scale_fill_colormap(discrete = T, colormap = colormaps$salinity,
     reverse = T ) +
    theme_classic() + 
    ylim(0,100) + ylab("") +
    coord_flip() +
    ylab("Percent") + xlab("")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p_acad, p_stat, ncol = 2)
```
<!-- Obviously, the most common languages used are Python, R, and SQL and Jupyter Notebooks as tool. In academia, SQL is less important and instead Matlab often applied.  -->


<!-- Python was the most commonly used data analysis tool across employed data scientists overall, but more Statisticians are still loyal to R. -->


#### Recommended programming language
Respondents were also asked what programming language they would recommend a new data scientist to learn first:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
question <- "LanguageRecommendationSelect"
recom_lang <- cleanMCData %>% 
  filter(!UQ(sym(question)) == "") %>%
  select(question) %>% 
  mutate(totalCount = n()) %>% 
  mutate(selections = strsplit(as.character(UQ(sym(question))), 
    '\\([^)]+,(*SKIP)(*FAIL)|,\\s*', perl = TRUE)) %>%
  unnest(selections) %>% 
  group_by(selections) %>% 
  summarise(totalCount = max(totalCount),
    count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percent = (count / totalCount) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  mutate(selections = fct_inorder(factor(selections)))
fig_cap_lang <- "Barplot showing the programming languages data scientist recommend most for newbies (ranked by their percentage off recommendation)."
```

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.asp=0.5, ig.align="center", tidy = TRUE, fig.cap=fig_cap_lang}
recom_lang %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = selections, y = percent, fill = selections)) +
  geom_col() + guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(direction = 1, option = "inferno") +
  theme_classic() + 
  ylab("Percent") + xlab("Recommended Language")
```

In marine sciences, the most common programming language is probably R, as it is most rich in packages and libraries related to methods applied in this field, closely followed by Matlab. However, if you plan to dive into the world of numerical modelling or you will work with big datasets such as genomics you are most likely better off with Python. I personally love R and have worked with it for many years, though at the time of my PhD it wasn't as easy to learn - without the many online tutorials and huge archives of questions and solutions at stack overflow that nowadays exist. For my own data storage I use relational databases, so SQL is my language of choice. And to communicate results and for teaching data science I also started to learn HTML and CSS. While the integration of RMarkdown into RStudio is great for producing output as PDF, presentation, HTML page or even entire website you need to learn a bit of HTML and CSS and potentially JavaScript, Bootstrap, etc. if you want to add your personal touch to it.

### Overview of programming languages and applications

Here is a short summary of different programming languages and data analysis software that are more or less common in marine data science, their pros and cons and links where you can learn more about it. Since I’m fully into R I also provide you later with a detailed - but not complete- list of R packages that are useful for general or marine- specific tasks.

**R** is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. R was released in 1995 as a direct descendant of the older S programming language and is currently supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. It is, like S,  designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.

In some ways R is not a typical programming language, as it's not a general purpose one. R's roots lies in statistics, as it has been developed specifically to deal with such needs. It provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. This is one of its particular stengths, its package system that allows the functional extension of R. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics. At present the official CRAN package repository features > 10,000 packages covering common and not-so-common tasks! It is through this, and its ties with the academic community, that R keeps up to date with all latest developments in data science and machine learning. Another of R’s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. 

One of R's downside as a result of its open-source and package system is that it has been plagued by issues such as memory management and security, and its syntax is not very straightforward or disciplined.

<img src="../img/software/logo_rstudio.jpg" alt="logo rstudio" style="float:left;clear:left;height:50px;border:0;padding-right:10px;">

####[www.rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com)

**RStudio** is a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R and has become the standard amongst R users in recent years. The program has an integrated text editor and data/package manager and helps writing and executing R code and analyzing data with R. It provides further version control, LaTeX integration, keyboard shortcuts, debugging tools and supports various different static and dynamic output formats through R Markdown. RStudio runs either on a desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a web browser connected to RStudio Server. It is partly written in the C++ programming language and uses the Qt framework for its graphical user interface. The bigger percentage of the code is written in Java.



<img src="../img/software/logo_python.png" alt="logo python" style="float:left;clear:left;height:50px;border:0;padding-right:10px;">

####[www.python.org](https://www.python.org)

**Python** is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. First released in 1991, Python has evolved to the fastest-growing programming language with an extensive range of purpose-built modules and community support. Many online services provide a Python API. Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace, and clear programming on both small and large scales. The language features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library. Interpreters are available for many operating systems. Python is considered as excellent all-rounder and particularly suitable for machine learning with libraries such as Google's Tensorflow.

A nice online tutorial on Python is available at [www.w3schools.com/python/](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)



<img src="../img/software/logo_cpp.png" alt="logo c++" style="float:left;clear:left;height:50px;border:0;padding-right:10px;">

####[www.isocpp.org](https://isocpp.org)

**C++** is a statically-typed, free-form, intermediate-level general-purpose, compiled programming language, with implementations of it available on many platforms. Many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM. C++ has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979, as an extension of the C language -the mother of all programming languages- as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for program organization. Since then C++ has influenced many other languages including C#, D, Java, and newer versions of C.

In that sense, C++ is not the ideal programming language for data analysis per se but rather for data analysis programs to base some of their functionality on (as done e.g. in R, RStudio). Code in C++ is also less readable as in R or Python. See the following example:

To print the text "Hello world!" you would type in C++

```C++
#Include stdout

Int main()

{

Std::cout <<"Hello, world!";

}
```

In R you would write
```{r, eval = FALSE}
print("Hello world!")
```

And in Python
```Python
Print ("Hello world!")
```


<img src="../img/software/logo_sql.png" alt="logo sql" style="height:50px;border:0;padding-right:10px;">

**SQL** ('Structured Query Language') defines, manages and queries relational databases. The language appeared by 1974 and has since undergone many implementations, but the core principles remain the same. Some implementations are free (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL), others proprietary (e.g. Oracle CHECK!!!!). SQL represents one of the favourites amongst data sciencists as indicated by the [kaggle survey](#kaggle_anchor). From advanced databases to NOSQL data stacks, SQL is used to parse data in the ETL stack, for advanced queries and for dealing especially with large databases, reducing the turnaround time for online requests by its fast processing time. Thus, SQL is more useful as a data processing language than as an advanced analytical tool. However, learning SQL can be a good addition into skills required for data science and ML experts, as this is looked after by most employers as a preferred skill set.

Common SQL database systems are: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html), Sybase, Informix, and MS Access.

A nice online tutorial on SQL is available at [www.w3schools.com/sql/](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)



<img src="../img/software/logo_java.png" alt="logo java" style="float:left;clear:left;height:50px;border:0;padding-right:10px;">

####[www.java.com](https://www.java.com/)

**Java** is another general-purpose, high-level, compiled and object-oriented language intended to have as few implementation dependencies possible and to run on all platforms without the need for recompilation. Its special feature is "write once, run anywhere" (WORA). Once the code is compiled to bytecode, it can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Thus, portability is one of the great facets of this language. Java was originally developed at Sun Microsystems, now owned by Oracle, and is nowadays one of the most popular programming languages amongst client-server web applications. A large number of companies, especially big multinational companies use the language to develop backend systems and desktop apps. Beside the criticism of speed[^1] and safety[^2], Jave is commonly used in software engineering. In marine data science, howeever it is less common.

A nice online tutorial on Java is available at [www.w3schools.com/java/](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)


<img src="../img/software/logo_fortran.jpg" alt="logo fortran" style="float:left;clear:left;height:50px;border:0;padding-right:10px;">

####[www.fortran.com](http://www.fortran.com/)

**Fortran** (formerly FORTRAN, derived from FORmula TRANslation) is a general-purpose, compiled imperative programming language that was designed for scientists and engineer in the 1950s by IBM. Fortran came to dominate this area of programming early on and has been in continuous use for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing[4] and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.[5] Revision of the language led to FORTRAN 77, the language we use today. The standard for FORTRAN 90 is now available although not yet in widespread use. F77 is a subset of F90.


<img src="../img/software/logo_matlab.jpg" alt="logo matlab" style="float:left;clear:left;height:50px;border:0;padding-right:10px;">

####[www.mathworks.com](https://www.mathworks.com/)

**MATLAB** is a numerical computing language developed by Mathworks in the 1980s and based of C, C++, and Java programming languages. MATLAB is a fast and stable program with solid algorithms for complex math and used throughout academia and industry. MATLAB is well-suited for quantitative applications with sophisticated mathematical requirements such as signal processing, Fourier transforms, matrix algebra and image processing. It also has some great in-built plotting options.

The major drawback of MATLAB are its high pricing for basic licenses and all additional libraries. Also, since MATLAB is not an open source language and, hence, does not allow users to easily extend the functionality, MATLAB does not keep up with latest developments in data science and machine learning as R or Python.


<img src="../img/software/logo_sas.png" alt="logo sas" style="float:left;clear:left;height:40px;border:0;padding-right:10px;">

####[www.sas.com](https://www.sas.com)
**SAS** is one of the most popular languages amongst statistians but less so in the data science community. It has a wide range of statistical functions with a user friendly GUI that helps data scientists learn quickly. It is an easy to learn programming language and preferred as a must have language for beginners entering analytics industry. The two biggest drawbacks are - similar to Matlab - its high pricing for the licenses as well as the limited flexibility for extending its functionality. 


<img src="../img/software/logo_jupyter.png" alt="logo jupyter" style="float:left;clear:left;height:50px;border:0;padding-right:10px;">

####[http://jupyter.org](http://jupyter.org/)

The **Jupyter Notebook** is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. The Notebook has support for over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala. Notebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer. The code run in Jypyter can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types.
<br>

#### Other

**Perl** ([www.perl.org](https://www.perl.org))<br>
Perl is an open source, general-purpose, interpreted cross platform programming language originally developed for text manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including system administration, web development, network programming, and GUI development.

**Julia** ([www.julialang.org](https://julialang.org/))<br>
Julia is a high level dynamic programming language designed to address the needs of high performance numerical analysis and computational science and is increasingly gaining popularity amongst data scientists. The base library written in Julia combines also open source C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. 

**Scala** ([www.scala-lang.org](https://www.scala-lang.org/))<br>
Scala is a general-purpose, scalable language, which is organized to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Scale has a large user interface, is quite user-friendly and can be used to write apps.

**Ruby** ([www.ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/))<br>
Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language developed in the 1990s that has a more coherent design than its close rivals (Pyhton and Perl). While the Ruby-on-Rails framework initially gained a big popularity in Web applications, it did not maintain momentum due to performance and scalability problems.

The non-profit initative [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) aims to make scientific data retrieval reproducible and has developed in the past an ecosystem of open source tools and reviewed community developed software. Various R packages have been built within the rOpenSci community useful for marine data scientists:

- [pangaear](https://github.com/ropensci/pangaear): This package offers tools to interact with the [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de) Database, including functions for searching for data, fetching datasets by dataset ID, and working with the PANGAEA OAI-PMH service.
- Climate data:
    - [ccafs](https://github.com/ropensci/ccafs): R client for Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) General Circulation Models (GCM) data.
- Geospatial data:
    - [mregions](https://github.com/ropensci/mregions): Package to access all of the data at [www.marineregions.org](http://www.marineregions.org). Allows visualization of marine regions with associated data paired with analysis, use of marine region geospatial boundaries to query data providers (e.g., [OBIS](http://www.iobis.org)), and geocoding.
    - [rnaturalearth](https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalearth): An R package to hold and facilitate interaction with natural earth map data. The [Natural Earth](www.naturalearthdata.com) website structures vector data by scale, category and type. These determine the filenames of downloads.

Once uploaded to a 'plotly' account, 'plotly' graphs (and the data behind them) can be viewed and modified in a web browser. More infos and examples can be found on [https://plot.ly/r](https://plot.ly/r) and [https://plot.ly/ggplot2](https://plot.ly/ggplot2). A good and comprehensive documentation is also given by the package creator Carson Sievert on [https://plotly-book.cpsievert.me](https://plotly-book.cpsievert.me/index.html).

#### Color schemes:

- [colormap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colormap/index.html): Allows to generate colors from palettes defined in the colormap module of 'Node.js' → see [https://github.com/bpostlethwaite/colormap](https://github.com/bpostlethwaite/colormap) for more information.

## Time series

See also the [TimeSeries](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html) CRAN task view for complementary information.

The base package **'stats'** offers various function for time series data: `ts()` creates time-series objects from vectors; the `ar()` and `arima()` functions fit  autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and integrated ARMA (ARIMA) time series model to the data. Classes "POSIXct" and "POSIXlt" implement the POSIX standard for date/time (intra-day) information and also support time zones and daylight savings time. However, the time zone computations require some care and might be system-dependent. Internally, "POSIXct" objects are the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 GMT. The 'tidyverse' package [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) provides functions that facilitate certain POSIX-based computations.

- [TSA](https://cran.r-project.org/package=TSA):

- [tseries](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tseries) and [zoo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=zoo): Both packages provide general handling and analysis of time series data. Irregular time series can be handled by using package 'zoo' as well as the function `irts()` in 'tseries' → for more info on 'zoo' see also the [Quick Reference vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/vignettes/zoo-quickref.pdf).
- [tsibble](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tsibble) and [tibbletime](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibbletime) build on the tidy principle and extend the tibble to store and manage temporal data. 'tsibble' provides a 'tbl_ts' class (the 'tsibble'), which is built on top of the 'tibble'. The 'tsibble' aims at easily manipulating and analysing temporal data, including counting and filling time gaps, aggregate over calendar periods, performing rolling window calculations, and etc. 'tibbletime' creates time aware tibbles that allows time-based subsetting on tibbles, a quick summary and aggregation of results by time periods, and creating columns that can be used as 'dplyr' time-based groups.
- [xts](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xts): eXtensible Time Series -

## Spatial analysis

While base R includes many functions that can be used for reading, visualising, and analysing spatial data, specific packages are required for "geographical" spatial data, where observations can be identified with geographical locations, and where additional information about these locations may be retrieved. A large number of these packages provide spatial statistical methods or interfaces to GIS, and many of them provide specific classes and plotting methods for spatial data. The following is only a small selection of most important packages. For a much more comprehensive overview of spatial packages in R see the [Spatial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) CRAN task view maintained by Roger Bivand as well as the [SpatioTemporal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/SpatioTemporal.html) task view maintained by Edzer Pebesma.

#### Fundamental packages 

Packages for class definition, import/export and handling of spatial data:

- [gdistance](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gdistance/index.html): Provides calculation of distances and routes on geographic grids.
- [geosphere](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geosphere/index.html): Permits computations of distance and area to be carried out on spatial data in geographical coordinates. 
- [landsat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/landsat/index.html): Provides tools for processing of Landsat or other multispectral satellite imagery. Includes relative normalization, image-based radiometric correction, and topographic correction options.
- [maptools](): Provides various mapping functions. It includes binary access to 'GSHHG' shoreline files. The package also provides interface wrappers for exchanging spatial objects with packages such as 'PBSmapping', 'spatstat', 'maps', 'RArcInfo', 'Stata tmap', 'WinBUGS', 'Mondrian', and others.
- [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html): The package is a major extension of spatial data classes to virtualise access to large rasters, permitting large objects to be analysed, and extending the analytical tools available for both raster and vector data. 
- [rgdal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html): R's interface to the popular C/C++ spatial data processing library [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org/). Maps may be vector-based or raster-based. The 'rgdal' package provides bindings to GDAL-supported raster formats and OGR-supported vector formats. It contains functions to write raster files in supported formats. The package also provides PROJ.4 projection support for vector objects ( this site provides searchable online PROJ.4 representations of projections). Both 'GDAL' and 'PROJ.4' libraries are external to the package, and, when installing the package from source, must be correctly installed first. Also the GeoJSON format can be written and read using 'rgdal'.
- [rgeos](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgeos/index.html): R's interface to the powerful vector processing library [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/).
- [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html): 'sf' is a new R package, which is meant to supersede 'sp'. It provides native support for [Simple Features](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf1.html) in R, can perform topological operations by interfacing with [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/), can read and write to a wide variety of spatial file formats courtesy of [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org/), and binds to [PROJ](https://proj4.org/) for projection conversions and datum transformations. Hence, 'sf' appears to do everything 'sp', 'rgdal', and 'rgeos' did, but in a more modern and intuitive fashion. My favourite thing about 'sf' is that the authors have adopted the **tidy data** principle: 
    - the package puts geometries in a list-column of class sfc , where each list element is a feature geometry of class sfg,
    - all functions begin with `st_` for easy RStudio tab completion, 
    - snake_case is used throughout the package,
    - 'dplyr' and 'tidyr' verbs have been defined for the sf objects,
    - functions are pipe-friendly, 
    - AND 'ggplot2' is able to plot sf objects directly → for more information check out the [sf website](http://r-spatial.github.io/sf/).
- [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html): 'sp' has been the standard for storing spatial data in R and many other packages have become dependent on the sp classes. The package provides classes and methods for spatial data (points, lines, polygons, grids) and utility functions for e.g. plotting data as maps, spatial selection, retrieving coordinates, subsetting, printint, summary, etc. → you'll find more info on the R-Forge [rspatial project](http://rspatial.r-forge.r-project.org/) website, including a visualisation gallery.
- [spacetime](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spacetime/index.html): Extends the shared classes defined in 'sp' for spatio-temporal data (see [Spatio-Temporal Data in R](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v051i07)).
- An alternative approach to the 'sp' classes and methods are the PBS packages:
    - [PBSmapping](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PBSmapping/index.html): Two-dimensional plotting features similar to those commonly available in a Geographic Information System. The package has evolved from fisheries research conducted at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada. 
    - [PBSmodelling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PBSmodelling/index.html): Provides modelling support. It focuses particularly on tools that make it easy to construct and edit a customized graphical user interface ('GUI').
  
#### Visualisation of spatial data

- [cartography](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cartography/index.html): This package allows various cartographic representations such as proportional symbols, choropleth, typology, flows or discontinuities → see also the [cheat sheet](http://riatelab.github.io/cartography/vignettes/cheatsheet/cartography_cheatsheet.pdf).
- [ggmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/index.html): Extends the plotting package 'ggplot2' for maps with a collection of functions to visualize spatial data and models on top of static maps from various online sources (e.g Google Maps and Stamen Maps).
- [ggsn](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsn/index.html): Adds north symbols (18 options) and scale bars in kilometers to maps in geographic or metric coordinates created with 'ggplot2' or 'ggmap'.    
- [leafletR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leafletR/index.html): Displays your spatial data on interactive web-maps using the open-source JavaScript library [Leaflet](Leaflet.). 'leafletR' can combine vector data and online map tiles from different sources. 
- [mapview](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapview/index.html): Creates interactive visualisations of spatial data with or without background maps. Attributes of displayed features are fully queryable via pop-up windows. Additional functionality includes methods to visualise true- and false-color raster images, bounding boxes, small multiples and 3D raster data cubes.
- [plotKML](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotKML/index.html): Visualization of spatial and spatio-temporal objects in Google Earth. Writes sp-class, spacetime-class, raster-class and similar spatial and spatio-temporal objects to KML following some basic cartographic rules.
- [rasterVis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rasterVis/index.html): Used with the 'raster' package it can provide enhanced visualisation and interaction. It implements visualization methods for quantitative data and categorical data, both for univariate and multivariate rasters. It also provides methods to display spatio-temporal rasters and vector fields. See the website for examples → see the [website](https://oscarperpinan.github.io/rastervis/) for more information.
- [rworldmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rworldmap/index.html): Enables mapping of country level and gridded user datasets. Modern country boundaries are provided at 2 resolutions by rworldmap along with functions to join and map tabular data referenced by country names or codes. Chloropleth and bubble maps are supported and general functions to work on user supplied maps (see [A New R package for Mapping Global Data](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_South.pdf).
- [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/index.html): Thematic maps are geographical maps in which spatial data distributions are visualized. This package offers a flexible, layer-based, and easy to use approach based on the Grammar of Graphics syntax to create thematic maps, such as choropleths and bubble maps → a nice introduction is provided [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html)!   


#### Spatial modelling / Geostatistics: 

The choice of package for spatial analysis and modelling will depend greatly on the type of data and its distribution. If the data are characterised by point support and the spatial process is continuous, geostatistical methods may be used or functions in the [nlme](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nlme/index.html) package, which is one of the base packages.

- [automap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/automap/index.html): This package performs an automatic interpolation by automatically estimating the variogram and then calling gstat.
- [geoR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geoR/index.html): Useful for model-based geostatistics including traditional, likelihood-based and Bayesian methods.
- [geoRglm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geoRglm/index.html): An extension to the package 'geoR', which must be installed first. 'geoRglm' provides functions for inference in generalised linear spatial models. The posterior and predictive inference is based on MCMC methods.
- [gstat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gstat/index.html): The package provides a wide range of functions for univariate and multivariate geostatistics, also for larger datasets. It covers, for instance, variogram modelling and plotting, various kriging methods, or sequential Gaussian or indicator (co)simulation → see also this [brief tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gstat/vignettes/gstat.pdf).
-  [ngspatial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ngspatial/index.html): Provides tools for analyzing ecological spatial data, especially non-Gaussian areal data.

- [spatial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatial/index.html): This package is shipped with base R, and contains several core functions for kriging and point pattern analysis.
- [SpatialTools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SpatialTools/index.html): This package has an emphasis on kriging, and provides functions for prediction and simulation. It is intended to be relatively straightforward, fast, and flexible.
- [spdep](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/index.html): If the support is areal, and the spatial process is not being treated as continuous, functions provided in the 'spdep' package may be used. This package can also be seen as providing spatial econometrics functions, and, as noted above, provides basic functions for building neighbour lists and spatial weights, tests for spatial autocorrelation for areal data like Moran's I, and functions for fitting spatial regression models. It provides the full range of local indicators of spatial association, such as local Moran's I and diagnostic tools for fitted linear models, including Lagrange Multiplier tests. Spatial regression models that can be fitted using maximum likelihood include spatial lag models, spatial error models, and spatial Durbin models. For larger data sets, sparse matrix techniques can be used for maximum likelihood fits, while spatial two stage least squares and generalised method of moments estimators are an alternative.
- [vardiag](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vardiag/index.html): Interactive variogram diagnostics may be carried out with this package.

## Multivariate analyses (supervised and unsupervised)

R and add-on packages provide a wide range of multivariate methods, many of which are specialised ordination and clustering techniques well suited for the analysis of species data. Two packages have become the leading add-on packages for multivariate data in environmental science: [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=vegan) and [ade4](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ade4). Both packages partly overlap in their functionality. Here, you should choose whichever framework best suits your background.

- [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=vegan): 'vegan' is a community ecology package, which follows the approach of Mark Hill, Cajo ter Braak and others as well as the approach presented in [Numerical Ecology](https://www.elsevier.com/books/numerical-ecology/legendre/978-0-444-53868-0) by Legendre & Legendre (1988). It provides ordination methods, diversity analysis and other functions for community ecologists.
- [ade4](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ade4): Derives from the traditions of the French school of  Analyse des Donnees and is based on the use of the duality diagram. The package provides tools for several multivariate analysis (i.e., ordination) of one-table (e.g., principal component analysis, correspondence analysis), two-table (e.g., coinertia analysis, redundancy analysis), three-table (e.g., RLQ analysis) and K-table (e.g., STATIS, multiple coinertia analysis) → see also [Dray and Dufour (2007)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v022i04).


Much ecological analysis proceeds from a matrix of dissimilarities between samples. Hence, a large amount of effort has been put into the development of a wide range of dissimilarity coefficients suitable for ecological data: `dist()` in the standard package 'stats', `daisy()` in 'cluster', `vegdist()` in 'vegan', `Dist()` in 'amap', `distance()` in 'ecodist', and a suite of functions in ade4.

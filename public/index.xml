      <description>If you are an R user but don’t know yet what Shiny and Shiny apps are, you definitely should read up on it on http://shiny.rstudio.com.
But in a nutshell, Shiny is an R package that builds interactive web apps straight from R. You just need to write an R script that follows a specific Shiny syntax and once you run the script, the package builds a HTML file as user interface (UI) with interactive input elements (based on Javascript) that trigger certain computations in R.</description>

      <title>oce package for oceanographical data</title>

      <description>In this post I will present the oce package, which can be handy for marine data scientist working with oceanographical data. oce provides lots of functions to
 read oceanographic data, process the data specific to the measuring instrument, and visualize results following oceanographic conventions (using the base graphics).  The key function for importing data into R is ?read.oce(), which automatically recognizes the file type. If the recognition does not work, try the individual functions (e.</description>

      <title>How to normalize the RMSE</title>
      <link>/blog/2019/01/07/normalizing-the-rmse/</link>

      <description>This post has been stimulated by a discussion with a colleague who asked about the normalization method for the root mean square error (NRMSE) in the INDperform R package, which is based on the indicator testing framework outlined in my article (Otto et al. 2018)1. At the time of writing the article and package I simply used a common approach and didn’t test it much further. But sparked by this discussion I started to test it thoroughly (as you will see below), which will make me revise the package.</description>

      <description>INDperform  Overview INDperform is an R package that implements a quantitative framework for selecting and validating the performance of state indicators tailored to meet regional conditions and specific management needs as described in Otto et al. (2018) 1 (see also my post on indicators).
The package builds upon the tidy data principles and offers functions to
 identify temporal indicator changes, model relationships to pressures while taking non-linear responses and temporal autocorrelation into account, and to quantify the robustness of these models.</description>

      <description>Indicators are useful and versatile tools applied in disciplines such as engineering, chemistry, medicine, economy or sociology. In ecosystem-based management a key role of an indicator is to inform on the current status of the system component as well as the effectiveness of specific management measures to move the component into a different state. In European Union (EU) marine policy, indicator development has recently progressed as part of the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD)1 to aid the achievement of Good Environmental Status (GES) of the EU’s marine waters by 2020.</description>

      <description>I am a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at the Institute of Marine Ecosystem and Fishery Science (formerly known as Institute for Hydrobiology and Fisheries Sciences). I have been working in the field of marine and freshwater ecology since my academic studies as researcher or consultant with a broad focus ranging from fish ecophysiology, diversity of marine temperate fouling communities, management of coral reefs and impacts of heavy metal pollution in the tropics to temperate freshwater fish communities and brackish pelagic food webs in recent years.</description>

      <description>Any comments or questions? Are you curious about something? Do you have any questions? Let me know and I will try to answer them. If you have any information on interesting data bases or R packages I should add to the list, let me know. And if you have any tutorial or online course related to MDS that you would like to share through this platform you are more then welcome!</description>

      <description>Databases In the following you find a list of databases and repositories that provide different type of marine data for specific regions free of charge. The list is not intended to be exhaustive but more to give you an easy start and many of these database can be webscraped directly from within R using specific packages that I also list here. If you feel there is any global or regional database missing where users can download marine data, don’t hesitate to contact me!</description>

      <description>What is Marine Data Science (MDS)? MDS is all about uncovering findings from marine data such as oceanographical data collected using both in situ methods and remote sensing. Typical parameters measured on-board relate to near-surface meteorological conditions (air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, cloudiness, etc.), sea surface conditions (e.g. sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, wave height, and wave direction) as well as subsurface water characteristics (vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, dissolved nutrients, ocean currents, or ocean bottom depth).</description>

      <description>Which programming languages should you learn for marine data science? First of all, there is no easy answer and no consensus either. Choosing from the broad range of programming languages the right one to invest time and effort learning it the next month or years is not trivial. It all boils down to what you plan to do with it and whether you want an open source program or can afford a license.</description>

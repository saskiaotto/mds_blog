      <description>INDperform  Overview INDperform is an R package that implements a quantitative framework for selecting and validating the performance of state indicators tailored to meet regional conditions and specific management needs as described in Otto et al. (2018) 1 (see also my post on indicators).
The package builds upon the tidy data principles and offers functions to
 identify temporal indicator changes, model relationships to pressures while taking non-linear responses and temporal autocorrelation into account, and to quantify the robustness of these models.</description>

      <description>This post compares a few change point detection method available in R given different time series dynamics and research questions. Change points or breakpoints are abrupt variations in time series data and may represent transitions between different states. The detection of change points is useful in modelling and prediction of time series and is found in application areas such as medical condition monitoring, speech and image analysis or climate change detection.</description>
